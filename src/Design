LinearEquation class
Instance variables:
1. private int xCoord -> x-coordinate.
2. private int yCoord -> y-coordinate.
Constructors:
1. public int xCoord()
   Use the int indexOf() method to find the index of "(" in the object and store it as the integer variable openParenthesisIndex.
   Use the int indexOf() method to find the index of "," in the object and store it as the integer variable commaIndex.
   Use the String substring() method with the parameters of openParenthesisIndex plus 1 and commaIndex to find the string x-coordinate in the object and store it as the String variable xCoordinate.
   Use the Integer.parseInt() method to convert the string variable xCoordinate and store it as the integer variable xCoord.
   Return xCoord.
2. public int yCoord()
   Use the int indexOf() method to find the index of "," in the object and store it as the integer variable commaIndex.
   Use the int indexOf() method to find the index of ")" in the object and store it as the integer variable closeParenthesisIndex.
   Use the String substring() method with the parameters of commaIndex plus 1 and closeParenthesisIndex to find the string y-coordinate in the object and store it as the String variable yCoordinate.
   Use the Integer.parseInt() method to convert the string variable yCoordinate and store it as the integer variable yCoord.
   Return yCoord.
3. public double slope(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)

Step 1: Import the Scanner class.
Step 2: Create Scanner object.
Step 3: Ask user to enter the first coordinate point.
Step 4: Store the input in the String variable coord1.
Step 5: Use the .xCoord() method on the String variable coord1 and store it as the integer variable coord1x.
Step 6: Use the .yCoord() method on the String variable coord1 and store it as the integer variable coord1y.
Step 7: Ask the user to enter the second coordinate point.
Step 8: Store the input in the String variable coord2.
Step 9: Use the .xCoord() method on the String variable coord2 and store it as the integer variable coord2x.
Step 10: Use the .yCoord() method on the String variable coord2 and store it as the integer variable coord2y.
